These benefits, coupled with its natural sourcing, make citranaxanthin a popular ingredient in the clean beauty movement.<p>Additionally, citranaxanthin is becoming a favored ingredient in color cosmetics, such as foundations, lipsticks, and blushes, where its pigmentation properties are utilized for natural coloring. The growing trend toward plant-based and naturally derived ingredients in beauty products has fueled demand for citranaxanthin. Consumers are increasingly aware of the ingredients in their skincare and beauty routines and are opting for products with safer, environmentally friendly options. As the clean beauty market expands, citranaxanthin’s application in cosmetics is likely to experience continued growth, driven by consumer demand for natural, effective, and sustainable skincare solutions.<h2>Food & Beverages</h2><p>In the food and beverage sector, citranaxanthin is primarily used as a natural food colorant, offering a yellow to orange hue that can replace synthetic alternatives in a variety of products.
