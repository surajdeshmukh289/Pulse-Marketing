This combination of affordability and variety makes supermarket and mall-based shopping a popular choice among American families for children’s winterwear.</p><p>In contrast, E-commerce has seen rapid growth and is increasingly becoming a dominant channel in the U.S. children’s apparel market. The rise of online shopping platforms has provided a convenient option for parents who prefer shopping from the comfort of their homes or for those residing in areas with limited access to physical retail stores.
